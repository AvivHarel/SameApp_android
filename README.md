*** Welcome to SAME app. ***

First, we are sorry that we dont have commits from different users.
we had some technic problems because Naor is using mac and Aviv is using windows and when we try to do commits and clone it was caused some problems.
so we had 2 different repositories, and this is the final result.


This project works with 2 platforms, web (.net) and android app.
In order to use our app, follow the next simple steps:

1. clone our repository, notice that we have 2 projects, the .net is the server & web app, and an android app.
2. run the server (.net), and wait for the web application to load.
3. run the android app
4. register to the app (in this version - only from the android).
5. log in (from both web or android) and start converstation.

** NOTE : if you are register from the android app, you have an option to add a profile picture. she will be display only in the phone, as required! **

** NOTE : you can speak only with users that logged in in the current server run. **

In order to check our app, register from at least 2 users, and log in into each of them. (you can use 2 different browsers / 2 phones or phone & browser)
once you did it - you can add a new contact to your chat and write them messages.

in this version, you can only send text messeages.

When you add a new contact - you need to supply:
1. his UserName that he registered with to the app DB.
2. a nickname that you want.
3. his server.

** NOTE : if you want to send a message from the web app, first click on the chat, and only after you see the chat opened - send it. **


**********************************************************************************************************************************
   Important: 
	     1. When you send a message or add a new contact, you will see the changes only after refresh. sorry for that.
	     2. The default server is localhost:7001.
	        in order to change it to your current server address you need to go to the settings page and set the server.
	        when you send your current server, set only the port. for example "5324".
	     3. If you add new contact from Web App the server is "localhost:5324", change only the digits the your server.

notice that each login session stands for 6000 seconds, and then the session will end and you will need to login again.

Thank you and enjoy :)
